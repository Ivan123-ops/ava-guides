This guide will help you to create a ERC-721 token which represents ownership of non-fingible tokens or NFTs.
In this case, every token is unique and and the same time can be transferred between individuals.

## 1. Setting up Metamask
First thing you need to do is to setup a custom RPC in your Metamask in order to connect to FUJI Testnet on Avalanche C-Chain. 
In case you want to operate on Mainnet, please, use the data for Mainnet.
Click on the network selection tool and choose Custom RPC.

You should use following credentials depending on what network you want to interact with. 
In this guide we will be using FUJI Testnet.

Network Name: Avalanche C-Chain

New RPC URL:
https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc for Fuji Testnet
https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc for Mainnet

ChainID:
0xa869 for Fuji Testnet
0xa86a for Mainnet

Symbol: C-AVAX

Explorer:
https://cchain.explorer.avax-test.network for Fuji Testnet
https://cchain.explorer.avax.network for Mainnet

After selecting network you should see this page.

Next step will be requesting C-AVAX tokens.

## 2. Acquiring faucet tokens
In order to operate on C-CHAIN, you will need to acquire C-AVAX tokens from the [faucet](https://faucet.avax-test.network/). 
Simple visit the link, provide your Ethereum address and click “REQUEST 10 AVAX”. 
Next, go to your Metamask and you will see updated balance. 
Tokens from this faucet are only for testing purposes and don’t represent any value.

## 3. Creating NFT token with Remix
Now it’s time to create our NFT! Visit [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), click “SOLIDITY” and “New file”. 
After that, navigate to the Workspaces section (files under the logo) and see a blank file, which you should rename. 
In this case we name it avatest.

We will use a ERC-721 OpenZeppelin contract, so there is no need no write anything on our own, we can just write
```
import “https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/presets/ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId.sol";
```
After this, go to the Solidity compiler section and press “Compile”. Press the “Compile avatest.sol” and return to the file directory.

Next, go to files section and find ***ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId.sol*** in presets.

After this, go to the Solidity compiler section and press “Compile”. 
Mind the compiler version, this should be higher than your source file is. For example, in our file, 
it’s written pragma solidity 0.8.0 and compiler is 0.8.4, so it’s ok. 
If you didn't change anything in the file, you should be OK.

This contract includes the following abilities:

*the ability for holders to burn (destroy) their tokens
*a minter role that allows for token minting (creation)
*a minter role that allows stopping all token transfers
*token ID and URI auto-generation

This contract is already ready for deployment so we don’t need to change anything and can move on
to “Deploy and run transactions” section which is right under Compiler icon.

## 4. Deployment

In this section, choose Injected Web3 environment and connect your Metamask account with C-AVAX funds we requested from the faucet.
In the “CONTRACT” field, select ***ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId.sol*** as it’s the main contract.

Right before deployment, click the button next to “Deploy” sign and fill in the requisites:

NAME — name of the token (AVATEST)
SYMBOL — (AVATEST)
BASETOKENURI — since we want to create NFT with an image, this image should have a URL and satisfy metadata criteria like
```
{
    "name": "Thor's hammer",
    "description": "Mjölnir, the legendary hammer of the Norse god of thunder.",
    "image": "https://game.example/item-id-8u5h2m.png",
    "strength": 20
}
```
For implementing an image, you will ned an image on JSON web server like [this](http://my-json-server.typicode.com/abcoathup/samplenft/tokens/0). 
However, if you want to skip image, just leave in blank. 
Press “Transact” button and confirm in Metamask.

In the lower sections, click debug and find transaction hash, copy it.

![Metamask](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5puq8a0vIGO2SkLqOYYZvw.png)

Then, navigate to the explorer and inset you txhash. 
You will see the wallet address (0x6F0935E3F3a53a659f6bAf938F387c626d784F84) 
and our NFT contract address — 0xB281Dd2aF018616e30A7dc484178122a18C6FBaf

We have deployed our contract but now let’s mint our first NFT!

## 5. Minting NFT
Return to the Deploy and run transactions section and click under “Deployed contracts”. 
Here you can see some functions of the contract.

The one that interests us the most — the mint function. 
Choose an address you want to mint NFT to (in this case we are using the same address we used for creation). 
Insert the address and confirm in Metamask.

## 6. Adding NFT token to Metamask
Open your Metamask Assets and click “Add token”. 
Insert the contract address we previously found out (in our case — 0xB281Dd2aF018616e30A7dc484178122a18C6FBaf), token symbol — AVATEST 
and since NFT is non-fungible — leave decimals at 0.

Now you can see the token in you Metamask! Congratulations!

## 7. Conclusion

We went through all the steps of creating a ERC721 on Avalanche Network. 
Now you can try to mint an NFT on mainnet go on to an NFT marketplace and sell it.
